# System operations shell for klish

Have you ever wished your Linux system to have a proper CLI like routers do?

Crave no longer! This is a set of klish definitions that make your
crappy evolution-convoluted Linux system feel a good bit more like
an engineered appliance.

There are about enough commands to make this feel like a useful
operations CLI, however many commands don't even have any options.

Please send patches by pull request.

Commands are provided for:

 * Examining network status (interfaces, routes...)
 * Examining system status (processes, memory, ACPI...)
 * Examining storage status (mounts, block devices, LVM...)
 * Querying local and online databases (NSS, DNS...)
 * Connecting to other hosts (ssh, ftp, tftp...)
 * Requesting system operations (shutdown, reboot...)
